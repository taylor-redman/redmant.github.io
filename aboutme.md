# about-me
## TL;DR: Became interested in the possibilities of computer science in high school. Plans on majoring in Computer Science because of the many different career paths that are available after graduation.

Taylor Redman is a freshman at Allegheny College and is planning on majoring in Computer Science with a double minor in Astronomy and History. Taylor chose to come to Allegheny College because he wanted a small campus environment and it was the perfect distance away from home. The school also awarded him with a Trustee Scholarship, which was a big motivator when he was making his final college decision. He is very excited for the next three and a half years at Allegheny and is looking forward to meeting new people and making lifelong memories.

Taylor was born in Buffalo, NY and lived there his entire life before coming to Meadville, PA. He is a lifelong Bills and Sabres fan even though they provide their fans with more pain and suffering than they do wins. Some of his hobbies include playing saxophone. He played soprano, alto and tenor throughout high school and currently plays tenor for the Allegheny Wind Symphony and Wind Ensemble. He also used to play for the Allegheny Club Ice Hockey team until concussions forced him to stop playing. He now fills in as coach for the team. Taylor just recently pledged with the Delta Tau Delta-Alpha Chapter fraternity on campus and is very excited to be part of such a well respected and long standing organization. Some other fun facts about Taylor are that he fancies himself a relatively good pool player and is always open for a quick game. He is also obsessed with The Lord of the Rings. While he has watched each of the three movies countless times, he has not yet found the time nor the effort to get through the books.

Taylor's future career aspirations include either working in the information security/ cyber-crime field or working for NASA, SpaceX or another astrophysics related agency. His other goals while at Allegheny are to maintain a 3.0 GPA or higher and study abroad during his junior year. Taylor became interested in computer science in high school when he took his school's introductory programming course. Since then he has been hooked and is certain he wants to make software, hardware and anything computer related an integral part of his life. He believes that since computing devices have become not only common but almost necessary in our everyday lives, that there will be a constant need for people to maintain and create new software and hardware.
