Google has become a powerhouse in the area of providing hardware and software to consumers that provide simple and well organized information. Many of their products, including their abundant mobile apps, are usually free to download and use. This bolsters Google's immense popularity. However, their are loopholes within Google's grand infrastructure. One of the most noticeable and pressing issues is in the area regarding crowd-sourcing and user input to contribute to some of Google's software. For example, Google Maps,Google My Business, Google Translate, and Google sponsored traffic applications allow for millions of users to add and modify content, often without many restrictions or regulations.

Google Maps and its corresponding traffic software varies slightly from how the other applications gather their information from users. While Maps can be modified using a variety of programs like Map Maker, OpenStreetMap project, Geo-Wiki, and Wikimapia, the traffic software continuously stores data from routes and directions people enter into the app.
