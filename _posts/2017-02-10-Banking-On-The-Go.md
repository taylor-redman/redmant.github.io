This is my first post, how exciting!

The Internet has become almost a necessity for everything in our lives to function. So many aspects of things we do everyday rely on the Internet to function in some way. Anything you check on your phone: the weather, news updates, social media feeds, miscellaneous facts discovered using a search engine all require a connection to the Internet to acquire information. The Internet and the Web have become parts of us as individuals and it is clear that we tend to express ourselves by using web related software or through the Internet. It has become an almost vital part of how we live our lives.

Mobile banking and banking apps have become an ever growing and useful tool since their conception. They enable individuals to manage, track, and transfer their funds while on the go. The software has become popular particularly due to its overall accessibility and ease of use. Because of the introduction of banking websites and mobile applications, it has decreased the need to physically visit a bank for all banking needs.

One of the major advantages is that it allows people to connect and share information quickly and relatively efficiently. On-line banking follows suit in that it allows individuals and/or businesses to financially connect with other individuals and businesses. With just a few clicks a person can transfer funds from one account to another, pay specific people through services like Venmo, and track their spending and savings in their bank accounts.

I personally use the mobile app provided by Citizens Bank. Their mobile applications for banking purposes have continuously been ranked as some of the most accessible and secure apps on the market. This is because the application is very streamlined and easy to approach for new users. Some of its features includes tracking each of your accounts and the balance in each, the ability to pay bills electronically, the ability to pay people remotely, a feature that allows the transfer of money from one account to another and a unique, new feature that allows a user to take a picture of a check and deposit that value into their account simply by submitting their photo.

One of the drawbacks of mobile banking that prevents it from becoming "mainstream" with some users is that they have to prove that they are secure and safe for people to use. While the Internet can be a very useful tool, it can also be used maliciously. The most major risk associated with security is the possibility that someone can acquire another individuals credit/debit card information. This can also lead to cases of identity theft if an intruder uses a person's card to access their personal information. Any possibility of this happening with be a cause for concern for some people who may be considering using mobile or web based banking for the first time.

The Internet and the Web has evolved from a primitive tool to a multitude of access points for information, media, and social interactions. It has taken up a permanent residence within the majority of our lives and will continue to evolve and shape how we interact with each other in the future. The possibilities to create new things using the power of the Web are endless and I'm excited for what the future has in store.
