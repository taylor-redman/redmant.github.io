Short Article 1

Publishing articles in markdown through a GitHub server proved to be very useful in creating a polished mobile ready website that contained all of my work throughout the year. At first it was hard to get used to a new word processor and submission system but after awhile it became very easy to understand and manipulate. Using Atom as a word processor was an interesting experience and was fun to learn its intricacies. The one thing that I had to get used to when using markdown was that it doesn’t have a very intuitive user interface. For example using a program like Google Docs or Microsoft Word, it provides the tools to change the font, color, and orientation and they are very easy to find and use whereas in Gvim or Atom, more steps have to be taken to make these changes.

Short Article 2

The ability to create extremely robust and professional looking presentations using GitHub and Reveal.js was something I found very pleased with. I had a lot of fun challenging myself to figure out how to make something a certain color or put in a specific transition. Once the first presentation was completed, it was very easy to make new ones because the original could be used as a template for new presentations. Learning how to create presentations in html has quite a learning curve and I’m still figuring out how to access certain tools and apply them to components of my presentations.
