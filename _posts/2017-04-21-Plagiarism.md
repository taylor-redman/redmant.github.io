TL;DR: It has become clear through extensive research that some individuals are more likely to plagiarize work than others. Certain demographics of students and scholars of a select number of backgrounds have shown that they copy work without proper citation at higher rates than other groups of students.


Many students, teachers, and professors are well aware of the fact that not only is plagiarism frowned upon in the world of academia, but is also a relatively common problem in education systems around the country and the world. The ever-expanding breadth of the Internet as well as many burgeoning software systems has made plagiarizing easier for students and at times harder to detect. A major problem associated with plagiarism is the issue of why select groups of individuals of certain backgrounds are more likely to plagiarize than other individuals. The article, The Shadow Scholar: The Man who Writes Your Students' Papers Tells His Story by Ed Dante, alludes to this possibility and provides evidence to support this fact.

One of the major factors that has led to this schism on plagiarism policies has been the varied and inconsistent education about plagiarism in education systems throughout the United States. Students that come from backgrounds that are less fortunate than others. Some school systems may lack the resources to have proper education on copying, cheating, and plagiarism on larger projects and assignments. Some might even say that there is not enough time in a student's day to have a session or class that educates them about plagiarism and its consequences. A solution would be to have a nationally implemented classroom policies that make it mandatory for schools to have either a specific class that helps students or have have teachers in their other classes each do their part to incorporate the risks of plagiarizing into their classrooms.   

Another factor that contributes to active plagiarism is that many institutions around the world don't even view plagiarism as a harmful act. Proponents of plagiarism may object that since scholarly work is intended to educate, then sharing published work for the sake of learning is an ethical act. While this statement has some moral validity, students and scholars deserve to be recognized when their work is being used by another. There is a level of respect that students and professionals should adhere to when planning on using someone else's published work. There is a person behind every paper or lab report and that person put forth a lot of time, effort, and possibly money to make the best project or assignment that they could. There are ethical boundaries that you shouldn't cross when citing someone's work. If it's not yours, cite whomever it came from. Plain and simple.

Conclusively, when discussing the topic of plagiarism, there are some that see plagiarism as a way of simply sharing knowledge to a broader audience. However the majority of people would agree that plagiarizing others is unfair to the students and scholars that put in the effort to create and publish their work to begin with.
