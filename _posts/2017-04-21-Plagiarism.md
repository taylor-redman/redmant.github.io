TL;DR: It has become clear through extensive research that some individuals are more likely to plagiarize work than others. Certain demographics of students and scholars of a select number of backgrounds have shown that they copy work without proper citation at higher rates than other groups of students.


Many students, teachers, and professors are well aware of the fact that not only is plagiarism frowned upon in the world of academia, but is also a relatively common problem in education systems around the country and the world. The ever-expanding breadth of the Internet as well as many burgeoning software systems has made plagiarizing easier for students and at times harder to detect. A major problem associated with plagiarism is the issue of why select groups of individuals of certain backgrounds are more likely to plagiarize than other individuals.
