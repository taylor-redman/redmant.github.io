When it comes to the topic of digital piracy, most of us would readily agree that downloading and distributing copyrighted content is inadvisable. Where this argument usually ends, however, is on the question of whether or not on-line piracy can be worthwhile for content creators. While some are convinced that piracy prohibits artists, filmmakers and media from receiving both the revenue and recognition for their work, others argue that the distribution of pirated content, particularly music and movies, aids in exposure and makes people's work available to a larger audience. Digital piracy has become ever more popular and frequent among young people and the power of the Internet has made the process of pirating media and other content easy and efficient. A survey taken at two New York colleges showed that 80% of students didn't see or have a problem with downloading copyrighted material for free. A colleague of mine, by the name of Brian, is a Computer Science major at Allegheny College and I talked with him about the issue of on-line piracy to gain an insight as to why it has become so prevalent and why it is most common among high school and college students. Here is what he had to say:

1.Why do you think that so many young people have a disregard for any consequences associated with pirating copyrighted material?

"I think there's a certain level of anonymity when you're hidden behind a screen. This can create a false sense of security for a lot of people and I think that's what drives a lot of the most common pirating; people thinking nobody can see what they're doing. That sort of mentality can get you into trouble for sure."

2.Do you think that people are educated enough on piracy laws and the punishments associated with breaking these laws?

"No, not nearly enough. I don't even know them to be honest. I know they're out but I can't think of many instances where I've seen or read about the details of the on-line piracy laws."

3.Pirating one copyrighted film can carry up to a $250,000 fine and the possibility of up to five years in prison. What is your opinion on the severity of punishments for pirating?

"They're kind of outrageous in my opinion. There are crimes more severe than illegally downloading a movie that have similar punishments. I don't agree with that one bit."

4.Because the power of the Internet has grown, do you think it is even necessary to have piracy laws considering people can circumvent copyright restrictions so easily?

"This is where it gets kind of tricky to talk about. In the current state of the piracy issue, it seems to me that any laws associated with it serve as only scare tactics in a way because so few people get caught when compared to the amount of pirating that takes place. I think there should be something in place to serve as a deterrent, but as for having no law, I'm not so sure about that."

5.You have been working on developing some mobile games and apps as a side project. Do you worry that your content is not going to be sufficiently protected when it is released to consumers?

"The apps that I'm working on at the moment I plan to make free to the public, so there's really no issue there. But if I were to develop an app that I wanted to sell, then yes there would be a sense of uneasiness I think and I would do my due diligence to make sure my stuff is safe."

6.Are there any precautions that you take to make sure your software is safe and secure?

"Well I'd probably try to put some sort of restriction(s) within the code of my apps. Maybe some sort of system where if the app is downloaded from an untrusted source it won't function correctly or won't launch. Something along those lines."

7.Have you ever pirated anything before and if so, what?

"Yeah, on occasion. I have a few albums of music on my phone that I downloaded awhile back. I know people who've streamed and copied movies, textbooks other computer software programs, you name it."

8.Why were you inclined to do it?

"Like I stated earlier, I admit I fell into the anonymity trap. I felt like nobody was watching. It made it a much easier conscious decision."

9.Would you do it again?

"To be honest, I think I would. By no means am I an avid law breaker but I think every now and then I could get some new music or a movie or two."

10.Overall, what is your stance on digital piracy?

"Here's the scoop, I think pirating gets a bad wrap and not all of it is really deserved. I think distributing downloaded music and movies can get stuff to a larger audience. For instance the music that I said I had downloaded was something I never heard before and now I love it because I downloaded it. Sure, it'll be labeled a 'crime' but I think as time goes on, people will become more open to it."

Conclusively, Brian ultimately felt that digital piracy really wasn't such a big deal. He felt that in the long run, it would help people more than it would harm them and hopes that either punishments or the laws themselves be altered to lesson the infractions placed on people who are caught pirating. His thoughts shed some light onto why younger people typically pirate more and it was interesting to know his stance on the issue.
